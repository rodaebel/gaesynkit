gaesynkit - Google App Engine Datastore/Local Storage Synchronization
=====================================================================

The gaesynkit framework enables Google App Engine application developers to
create entities in the local storage of a web client and synchronize them with
the server-side Datastore at a later point of time. So, offline editing becomes
easier and more secure through a high level API.
